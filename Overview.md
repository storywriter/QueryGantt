# About the extension
Query Gantt is an extension for the Azure DevOps, which enables you to view the result of the selected query in the form of a Gantt chart using the [vis-timeline](https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/) and export it to the excel file using the [xlsx-populate](https://github.com/dtjohnson/xlsx-populate) parser/generator.

# Setup
After installing the extension from the Marketplace, you need to enable it in the **Manage features**  section. In order to do so, follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/preview-features?view=azure-devops).

# How does it work
Query Gantt can be used for any type of the query, but only those work items which have the **Start Date** (Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StartDate) and **Target Date** (Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.TargetDate)
set will be visualised on the timeline.

Which work items have the **Start Date** and the **Target Date** depends on the process you are using in your project. However you can add these fields to your work items following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/settings/work/add-custom-field?view=azure-devops).

If the work item has set up both **Start Date** and **Target Date** it will be rendered as a bar, if the work item has set up only the **Target Date** it will be rendered as a marker on the timeline.
